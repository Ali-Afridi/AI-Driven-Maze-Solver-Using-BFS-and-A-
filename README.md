# AI-Driven-Maze-Solver-Using-BFS-and-A-
Developed a Python-based AI maze solver using BFS and A* algorithms, visualized through
the Tkinter GUI.
Implemented both uninformed (BFS) and informed (A*) search strategies to find optimal
paths through randomly generated mazes with dynamic obstacle placement.
Designed the system using object-oriented programming for modularity and scalability.
Enabled user interaction for obstacle placement and real-time pathfinding visualization.
Technologies: Python, OOP
